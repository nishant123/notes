Step-1: Open the command prompt and run the following command.
npm install -g json-server 

Step-2: Create a db.json file in a directory. In our demo we will perform operations on articles with three fields that are id, title and category. 
db.json
{
  "articles": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Android AsyncTask Example",
      "category": "Android"
    }
  ]
} 

Step-3: Now we need to run the json-server. Go to the directory where db.json file is lying and then run following command.
json-server --watch db.json 

Step-4: In this way, we are ready to use json-server with following URLs.
http://localhost:3000/articles The above URL will fetch all articles. 
Step-5: For CRUD operation we need to use following URLs. 
1. GET /articles : Fetches all articles. 
2. GET /articles/1 : Fetches article by id. 
3. POST /articles : Create article. 
4. PUT /articles/1 : Update article by id. 
5. DELETE /articles/1 : Delete article by id.

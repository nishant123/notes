Question:Please explain the Geolocation API in HTML5. How will you create a Geolocation object?
Answer: The Geolocation API in HTML5 allows users to share their location with selected websites. J.S. is capable of capturing a user's latitude and longitude and sending the same to the backend server.

Doing so enables location-aware features like finding local places of interest and finding out one's location on the map. 


Question: Explain the difference between div and span.
Answer: Both div and span are used for giving out the output. While span gives the output with display: inline, div gives output with display: block. Typically, span is used when there is the need to display the elements one after the other, i.e., in a line.

Question: What do you understand by HTML5 Web Storage? Is it any better than Cookies?
Answer: Prior to HTML5, web pages were able to store data locally within a browser using cookies. The HTML5 introduces Web Storage that allows a webpage to do the same as that of the cookies. Web Storage, however, is faster and more secure than cookies.

The HTML5 Web Storage is faster because the data isn't included with every server request. Instead, it is used when asked for. A web page can only access the data stored by itself, which is stored in name/value pairs

Another important distinction between the HTML5 Web Storage and Cookies is that:

Web Storage never transfers the data to the server, and
When compared to cookies, the storage limit for the HTML5 Web Storage is much larger, at least 5MB, and at max 10MB.


Question: Please explain localStorage and sessionStorage.
Answer: Both localStorage and sessionStorage are scoped to the document origin. This ensures that documents with different origins never share stored objects. Unlike localStorage, sessionStorage is also scoped on a per-window basis.

If, for example, two browser tabs are displaying documents from the same origin, both will have separate sessionStorage data, i.e., the scripts running in one browser tab can't read or overwrite the data written by scripts in the other. This is true even if both browser tabs are visiting the totally same page and are running the absolutely same scripts.

The difference between the localStorage and the sessionStorage lies on the basis of the lifetime and the scope. Data stored via localStorage is permanent, i.e., it doesn't expire and remains stored on a computer until:

A web app deletes it, or
The user requests the browser to delete it
Data stored via sessionStorage, on the other hand, gets deleted when the window or tab concerning the same is closed. sessionStorage has the same lifetime as that of the top-level window or browser tab that has the script running, which stored the data.


Question: Why do you think the addition of drag-and-drop functionality in HTML5 is important? How will you make an image draggable in HTML5?
Answer: When it comes to UI interaction, the drag-and-drop is essential functionality. Almost all modern U.I.s have it. It makes copying, moving, and linking an object, such as an image or a link, very easy.

To make an image draggable in HTML5, we need to set the draggable image attribute true i.e.:

type = <img draggable = "true">

Question: What do you understand by image maps in HTML5? How many types does it have?
Answer: Image maps allow users to click on images for opening new web pages. As such, these are a combination of images and URLs. Image maps are of two types:

Client-side Image Map - Created using <area> and <map> elements. The map element holds the map information, and the area element takes the attributes for defining each section of the map.
Server-side Image Map - Created using the <usemap> attribute, which is the name of the map.


Question: Why do we need the MathML element in HTML5?
Answer: MathML stands for Mathematical Markup Language. It is a form of XML for describing the Math notation. MathML is a markup language for displaying mathematical and scientific expressions over web pages.

For implementing the MathML element i.e. displaying a mathematical equation, we put it inside the <math> and </math> tags.

Answer: The most important drawback is privacy as cookies keep track of all the websites a user visits, and any third-party can access the cookies' information. This could be misused by hackers or malicious persons to access confidential information like passwords or credit card details.

Question: What is the server-sent events in HTML5?
Answer: The events that flow from the webserver to the browsers are called server-sent events. DOM events can be continuously pushed from the webserver to the browser of a user. To use a server-sent event (SSE), you should add an <eventsource> element to the document. The src attribute of this element describes the HTTP connection location, which sends a data stream having the events.

Example: <eventsource src = "/cgi-bin/myfile.cgi" />


Question: How to utilize a server-sent event in HTML5?
Answer: Server-sent events are most useful when we need long-term connection with the webserver. In such cases, the web page can hold an open connection to a web server, and the server can send a response anytime without having to reconnect.

Question: What are web sockets?
Answer: Web sockets are API or protocols that define persistent socket connections between the web browser and the server. A WebSocket connection can be opened by calling the Websocket constructor and passing the URL in the URL schema. URL schema can be ws, wss. Optionally, other subprotocols like soap, XMPP, etc. can be passed to the constructor. Websockets help in two-way communication and handle proxies and firewalls.

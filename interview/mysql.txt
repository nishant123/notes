1. What is MySQL?
MySQL is a database management system for web servers. It can grow with the website as it is highly scalable. Most of the websites today are powered by MySQL.

2. What are some of the advantages of using MySQL?
Flexibility: MySQL runs on all operating systems
Power: MySQL focuses on performance
Enterprise-Level SQL Features: MySQL had for some time been lacking in advanced features such as subqueries, views, and stored procedures.
Full-Text Indexing and Searching
Query Caching: This helps enhance the speed of MySQL greatly
Replication: One MySQL server can be duplicated on another, providing numerous advantages
Configuration and Security
3. What do you mean by ‘databases’?
A database is a structured collection of data stored in a computer system and organized in a way to be quickly searched. With databases, information can be rapidly retrieved.

4. What does SQL in MySQL stand for?
The SQL in MySQL stands for Structured Query Language. This language is also used in other databases such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.  One can use commands such as the following to send requests from a database:

SELECT title FROM publications WHERE author = ' J. K. Rowling’;

Note that SQL is not case sensitive. However, it is a good practice to write the SQL keywords in CAPS and other names and variables in a small case.
You can check out this SQL Tutorial to learn more about SQL. 

5. What does a MySQL database contain?
A MySQL database contains one or more tables, each of which contains records or rows. Within these rows are various columns or fields that contain the data itself.

6. How can you interact with MySQL?
There are three main ways you can interact with MySQL: 

using a command line
via a web interface
through a programming language
7. What are MySQL Database Queries?
A query is a specific request or a question. One can query a database for specific information and have a record returned.

8. What are some of the common MySQL commands?
Command	Action
ALTER	To alter a database or table
BACKUP	To back-up a table
\c	To cancel Input
CREATE	To create a database
DELETE	To delete a row from a table
DESCRIBE	To describe a table's columns
DROP	To delete a database or table
EXIT(ctrl+c)	To exit
GRANT	To change user privileges
HELP (\h, \?)	Display help
INSERT	Insert data
LOCK	Lock table(s)
QUIT(\q)	Same as EXIT
RENAME	Rename a Table
SHOW	List details about an object
SOURCE	Execute a file
STATUS (\s)	Display the current status
TRUNCATE	Empty a table
UNLOCK	Unlock table(s)
UPDATE	Update an existing record
USE	Use a database
9. How do you create a database in MySQL?
Use the following command to create a new database called ‘books’:

CREATE DATABASE books;

10. How do you create a table using MySQL?
Use the following to create a table using MySQL:

CREATE TABLE history (
author VARCHAR(128),
title VARCHAR(128),
type VARCHAR(16),
year CHAR(4)) ENGINE InnoDB;
11. How do you Insert Data Into MySQL?
The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new records to a MySQL table:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3,...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...)
If we want to add values for all the columns of the table, we do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, the order of the values should be in the same order as the columns in the table. The INSERT INTO syntax would be as follows:

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
12. How do you remove a column from a database?
You can remove a column by using the DROP keyword:

ALTER TABLE classics DROP pages;

13. How to create an Index in MySQL?
In MySQL, there are different index types, such as a regular INDEX, a PRIMARY KEY, or a FULLTEXT index. You can achieve fast searches with the help of an index. Indexes speed up performance by either ordering the data on disk so it's quicker to find your result or, telling the SQL engine where to go to find your data.

Example: Adding indexes to the history table:

ALTER TABLE history ADD INDEX(author(10));
ALTER TABLE history ADD INDEX(title(10));
ALTER TABLE history ADD INDEX(category(5));
ALTER TABLE history ADD INDEX(year);
DESCRIBE history;
14. How to Delete Data From a MySQL Table?
In MySQL, the DELETE statement is used to delete records from a table:

DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = value_name
15. How do you view a database in MySQL?
One can view all the databases on the MySQL server host using the following command:

mysql> SHOW DATABASES;  

16. What are the Numeric Data Types in MySQL?
MySQL has numeric data types for integer, fixed-point, floating-point, and bit values, as shown in the table below. Numeric types can be signed or unsigned, except BIT. A special attribute enables the automatic generation of sequential integer or floating-point column values, which is useful for applications that require a series of unique identification numbers.

Type Name	Meaning
TINYINT	Very Small Integer
SMALLINT	Small Integer
MEDIUMINT	Medium-sized Integer
INT	Standard Integer
BIGINT	Large Integer
DECIMAL	Fixed-point number
FLOAT	Single-precision floating-point number
DOUBLE	Double-precision floating-point number
BIT	Bit-field
17. What are the String Data Types in MySQL?
Type Name	Meaning
CHAR	fixed-length nonbinary(character) string
VARCHAR	variable-length nonbinary string
BINARY	fixed-length binary string
VARBINARY	variable-length binary string
TINYBLOB	Very small BLOB(binary large object)
BLOB	Small BLOB
MEDIUMBLOB	Medium-sized BLOB
LONGBLOB	Large BLOB
TINYTEXT	A very small nonbinary string
TEXT	Small nonbinary string
MEDIUMTEXT	Medium-sized nonbinary string
LONGTEXT	Large nonbinary string
ENUM	An enumeration; each column value is assigned, one enumeration member
SET	A set; each column value is assigned zero or more set members
NULL	NULL in SQL is the term used to represent a missing value. A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank. This value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces.
18. What are the Temporal Data Types in MySQL?
Type Name	Meaning
DATE	A date value, in ' CCYY-MM-DD ' Format
TIME	A Time value, in ' hh : mm :ss ' format
DATETIME	Date and time value, in ' CCYY-MM-DD hh : mm :ss ' format
TIMESTAMP	A timestamp value, in ' CCYY-MM-DD hh : mm :ss ' format
YEAR	A year value, in CCYY or YY format
Example: To select the records with an Order Date of "2018-11-11" from a table:

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2018-11-11'
19. What is BLOB in MySQL?
BLOB is an acronym that stands for a binary large object. It is used to hold a variable amount of data.
There are four types of BLOB:

TINYBLOB
BLOB
MEDIUMBLOB

Intermediate MySQL Interview Questions
1. What are MySQL “Views”?
In MySQL, a view consists of a set of rows that is returned if a particular query is executed. This is also known as a ‘virtual table’. Views make it easy to retrieve the way of making the query available via an alias. 
The advantages of views are:

Simplicity
Security
Maintainability
2. How do you create and execute views in MySQL?
Creating a view is accomplished with the CREATE VIEW statement. As an example:

CREATE
   [OR REPLACE]
   [ALGORITHM = {MERGE | TEMPTABLE | UNDEFINED }]
   [DEFINER = { user | CURRENT_USER }]
   [SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }]
   VIEW view_name [(column_list)]
   AS select_statement
   [WITH [CASCADED | LOCAL] CHECK OPTION]
3. What are MySQL Triggers?
A trigger is a task that executes in response to some predefined database event, such as after a new row is added to a particular table. Specifically, this event involves inserting, modifying, or deleting table data, and the task can occur either prior to or immediately following any such event. 
Triggers have many purposes, including:

Audit Trails
Validation
Referential integrity enforcement
4. How many Triggers are possible in MySQL?
There are six Triggers allowed to use in the MySQL database:

Before Insert
After Insert
Before Update
After Update
Before Delete
After Delete
5. What is the MySQL server?
The server, mysqld, is the hub of a MySQL installation; it performs all manipulation of databases and tables.

6. What are the MySQL clients and utilities?
Several MySQL programs are available to help you communicate with the server. For administrative tasks, some of the most important ones are listed here:

• mysql—An interactive program that enables you to send SQL statements to the server and to view the results. You can also use mysql to execute batch scripts (text files containing SQL statements).

• mysqladmin—An administrative program for performing tasks such as shutting down the server, checking its configuration, or monitoring its status if it appears not to be functioning properly.

• mysqldump—A tool for backing up your databases or copying databases to another server.

• mysqlcheck and myisamchk—Programs that help you perform table checking, analysis, and optimization, as well as repairs if tables become damaged. mysqlcheck works with MyISAM tables and to some extent with tables for other storage engines. myisamchk is for use only with MyISAM tables.

7. What are the types of relationships used in MySQL?
There are three categories of relationships in MySQL:

One-to-One: Usually, when two items have a one-to-one relationship, you just include them as columns in the same table.
One-to-Many: One-to-many (or many-to-one) relationships occur when one row in one table is linked to many rows in another table.
Many-to-Many: In a many-to-many relationship, many rows in one table are linked to many rows in another table. To create this relationship, add a third table containing the same key column from each of the other tables
Advanced MySQL Interview Questions
1. Can you explain the logical architecture of MySQL?
The top layer contains the services most network-based client/server tools or servers need such as connection handling, authentication, security, and so forth.
The second layer contains much of MySQL’s brains. This has the code for query parsing, analysis, optimization, caching, and all the built-in functions.

The third layer contains the storage engines that are responsible for storing and retrieving the data stored in MySQL.


2. What is Scaling in MySQL?
In MySQL, scaling capacity is actually the ability to handle the load, and it’s useful to think of load from several different angles such as:

Quantity of data
Number of users
User activity
Size of related datasets
3. What is Sharding in SQL?
The process of breaking up large tables into smaller chunks (called shards) that are spread across multiple servers is called Sharding. 
The advantage of Sharding is that since the sharded database is generally much smaller than the original; queries, maintenance, and all other tasks are much faster.

4. What are Transaction Storage Engines in MySQL?
To be able to use MySQL’s transaction facility, you have to be using MySQL’s InnoDB storage engine (which is the default from version 5.5 onward). If you are not sure which version of MySQL your code will be running on, rather than assuming InnoDB is the default engine you can force its use when creating a table, as follows.

Conclusion
1. Conclusion
Several free or low-cost database management systems are available from which to choose, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

When you compare MySQL with other database systems, think about what’s most important to you. Performance, features (such as SQL conformance or extensions), support, licensing conditions, and price all are factors to take into account.

MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing various web-based software applications.

MySQL is offered under two different editions: the open-source MySQL Community Server and the proprietary Enterprise Server.
Given these considerations, MySQL has many attractive qualities:

Speed
Ease of use
Query language support
Capability
Connectivity and security
Portability
Availability and cost
Open distribution and source code

For, your better understanding, I will be considering the following tables to write queries.

To retrieve the even records from a table, you have to use the MOD() function as follows:

1
SELECT EmpID FROM (SELECT rowno, EmpID from EmployeeInfo) WHERE MOD(rowno,2)=0;
Similarly, to retrieve the odd records from a table, you can write a query as follows:

1
SELECT EmpID FROM (SELECT rowno, EmpID from EmployeeInfo) WHERE MOD(rowno,2)=1;
Q19. Write a SQL query to retrieve employee details from EmployeeInfo table who have a date of joining in the EmployeePosition table.

SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo E 
WHERE EXISTS 
(SELECT * FROM EmployeePosition P WHERE E.EmpId = P.EmpId);
Q20. Write a query to retrieve two minimum and maximum salaries from the EmployeePosition table.
To retrieve two minimum salaries, you can write a query as below:

1
2
3
SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM EmployeePosition E1 
 WHERE 2 >= (SELECTCOUNT(DISTINCT Salary)FROM EmployeePosition E2 
  WHERE E1.Salary >= E2.Salary) ORDER BY E1.Salary DESC;
To retrieve two maximum salaries, you can write a query as below: 
1
2
3
SELECT DISTINCT Salary FROM EmployeePosition E1 
 WHERE 2 >= (SELECTCOUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM EmployeePosition E2 
  WHERE E1.Salary <= E2.Salary) ORDER BY E1.Salary DESC;

Q21. Write a query to find the Nth highest salary from the table without using TOP/limit keyword.

SELECT Salary 
FROM EmployeePosition E1 
WHERE N-1 = ( 
      SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT ( E2.Salary ) ) 
      FROM EmployeePosition E2 
      WHERE E2.Salary >  E1.Salary );
Q22. Write a query to retrieve duplicate records from a table.
1

3
SELECT EmpID, EmpFname, Department COUNT(*) 
FROM EmployeeInfo GROUP BY EmpID, EmpFname, Department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Q23. Write a query to retrieve the list of employees working in the same department.
1

Select DISTINCT E.EmpID, E.EmpFname, E.Department 
FROM EmployeeInfo E, Employee E1 
WHERE E.Department = E1.Department AND E.EmpID != E1.EmpID;
Q24. Write a query to retrieve the last 3 records from the EmployeeInfo table.
1

Q26. Write a query to display the first and the last record from the EmployeeInfo table.
To display the first record from the EmployeeInfo table, you can write a query as follows:

1
SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo WHERE EmpID = (SELECT MIN(EmpID) FROM EmployeeInfo);
To display the last record from the EmployeeInfo table, you can write a query as follows:

1
SELECT * FROM EmployeeInfo WHERE EmpID = (SELECT MAX(EmpID) FROM EmployeeInfo);
Q27. Write a query to add email validation to your database
1
SELECT Email FROM EmployeeInfo WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(Email, ‘[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+.[A-Z]{2,4}’, ‘i’);
Q28. Write a query to retrieve Departments who have less than 2 employees working in it.
1
SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(EmpID) as 'EmpNo' FROM EmployeeInfo GROUP BY DEPARTMENT HAVING COUNT(EmpD) < 2;
Q29. Write a query to retrieve EmpPostion along with total salaries paid for each of them.
1
SELECT EmpPosition, SUM(Salary) from EmployeePosition GROUP BY EmpPosition;
Q30. Write a query to fetch 50% records from the EmployeeInfo table.

3
SELECT * 
FROM EmployeeInfo WHERE
EmpID <= (SELECT COUNT(EmpID)/2 from EmployeeInfo);
So this brings us to the end of the SQL Query  Interview Questions article. I hope this set of SQL 

the main differences between INNODB and MYISAM
The most commonly used storage engine in MySQL are MyISAM and InnoDB.

With these storage engine there are some advantages and disadvantages according to application needs.

As you all know, the default storage engine chosen by MySQL database is MyISAM.

The main difference between MyISAM and INNODB are :

MyISAM does not support transactions by tables while InnoDB supports.
There are no possibility of row-level locking, relational integrity in MyISAM but with InnoDB this is possible. MyISAM has table-level locking.
InnoDB does not support FULLTEXT index while MyISAM supports.
Performance speed of MyISAM table is much higher as compared with tables in InnoDB.
InnoDB is better option while you are dealing with larger database because it supports transactions, volume while MyISAM is suitable for small project.
As InnoDB supports row-level locking which means inserting and updating is much faster as compared with MyISAM.
InnoDB supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) property while MyISAM does not support.
In InnoDB table,AUTO_INCREMENT field is a part of index.
Once table in InnoDB is deleted then it can not re-establish.
InnoDB does not save data as table level so while implementation of select count(*) from table will again scan the whole table to calculate the number of rows while MyISAM save data as table level so you can easily read out the saved row number.
MyISAM does not support FOREIGN-KEY referential-integrity constraints while InnoDB supports.
